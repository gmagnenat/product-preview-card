## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to implement the picture element with different sources. It allows me to display different images for different viewport.

### Continued development

Use more mixins and function to create reusable and flexible tools.
**ideas** : for buttons, for image color manibulation, for card component, for grid layout

### Useful resources

- [Responsive image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - This helped me understand how to use art direction with the picture element and serve different images at different viewport width.
- [Font sizes best practices ](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/font-size-px/) - This helped me understand more how to properly uses sizes for accessibility
- [sass:color](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color/) - I used this ressource to write my button mixin and the hover color
